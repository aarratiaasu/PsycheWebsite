            <h1>How did Psyche get its name</h1>

        <p>
            Psyche was discovered in 1852 by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis. Because it was the 16th asteroid to be 
            discovered, it is sometimes referred to as 16 Psyche. Itâ€™s named for the goddess of the soul 
            in ancient Greek mythology, often depicted as a butterfly-winged female figure.

        <h1>Location in our Solar System</h1>
        <p>
            Psyche is located in between Mars and Jupiter, and because Psyche and Earth orbit at different speeds, the distance from Earth to Psyche varies from less than 186 million miles to more than 372 million miles

            Psyche's surface is believed to very greatly, as radar technology has provided us with
